for the entire class to enjoy.  You walk up to this box and discover the box is
completely empty.  All that is left is a partially chewed {{ detective.favorite }}
donut.  Enraged that the donuts are all gone, your frantic eyes search for clues as to who
could have perpetrated such an injustice, and your eye falls upon {{ suspect.dropped }}</p>
