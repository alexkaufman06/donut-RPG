# Donut RPG
This is an app I that is very similar to the boardgame clue.  Once the user enters their name, a random Epicodus classmate
is assigned as the donut theif.  Each classmate has clues that they drop in the story line to guide the player's choice.  It 
was good practice in learning about controllers and factories in Angular-ui.
